# Contact App with JavaFX
A JavaFX application for managing a contact list.

## Features
* Desktop app with JavaFX-based UI
* Data bound to the TableView using FXCollections.ObservableArrayList
* Add, edit, delete contacts
* Search contacts
* Save and load data from an .xml file

## Description
The main form displays a table of all the contacts in your list. You can add a new contact by clicking the "Add" button, or edit or delete an existing contact by selecting it and clicking the respective button.

The contacts are automatically sorted by last name. To search/filter the contacts, enter a search term in the search field.

The contact list is saved to an .xml file every time changes are made to the contact list, and it is loaded back into the TableView when you launch the application again.

## Credits
The app was originally based on a challenge from the Java Programming Masterclass on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/).
